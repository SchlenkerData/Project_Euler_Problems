# # Project Euler Problem 21
# 
# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
# 
# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
# 
# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

# The function divisorsum(k) gets the sum of proper divisors of k
# by going through all numbers i from 2 to sqrt(k) and checking
# divisibility.  If i is the square root of k, we just add that
# to the sum of divisors.  Otherwise, if i is a divisor of k 
# less than the square root of k, we add i and k/i to 
# the sum of divisors.  Remember that 1 is always a divisor of
# any integer, so we add that at the end.
