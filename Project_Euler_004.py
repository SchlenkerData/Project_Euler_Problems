# # Project Euler Problem 4
# 
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# 
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
# 

# In[1]:


# We use a nested for loop to check all possible products of 
# 3-digit numbers.  To check if the product is a palindrome, we
# convert the product to a string, reverse the string, convert
# back to an integer, then see if that's equal to the original product.
